	   <p> I've been making art since I was in 4th grade, and I don't plan to stop any time soon. My interest in the sciences, particularly psychology and biology, developed from a curiousity to further understand humans. To me, these two disciplines cannot exist without each other-- and they shouldn't have to. </p>
