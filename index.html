	<h3>Artist &amp; Scientist</h3> 
	<p>Art and science have historically never gotten along. However, I've been making art since I was in 4th grade, and I don't plan to stop any time soon. My interest in the sciences, particularly psychology and biology, developed from a curiousity to further understand humans. To me, these two disciplines cannot exist without each other-- and they shouldn't have to.</p>
